 Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Data Science Job Simulation on Forage - June 2024
 
I have participated in Commonwealth Bank's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Data Science team at Commonwealth Bank.

I worked on a project to create a data engineering pipeline to aggregate and extract insights from a data set. I practiced using BigQuery, Microsoft Excel and built my data analysis skills in a real-world context.

Doing this program confirmed that I enjoy designing the structure of information in a database, and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Data Science team at a company like Commonwealth Bank.

- Completed a job simulation involving Data Management skills for Commonwealth Bank's Data Science team.
- Demonstrated proficiency in creating data engineering pipelines to aggregate and extract valuable insights from datasets, optimizing data-driven decision-making.
- Acquired skills in anonymizing personal data within datasets, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.
- Proposed effective data analysis approaches, particularly related to social media, and demonstrated the ability to design well-structured databases for efficient information management.
